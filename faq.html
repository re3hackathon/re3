      <h3 class="question" id="what_is_storytelling">What is justice-based persuasive storytelling?</h3>
      <p>"Storytelling" is a popular word these days. Overused even. This is what it means to us:</p>
      <p>Changemakers working on the most pressing issues tend to be deep in the facts, and rarely do facts change people’s minds. That's because people tend to have an existing story in their head that explains their daily experience - whether it's about crime and punishment, race, immigration, the weather, the food we eat or how we treat our neighbours.</p>

      <p>To reach people, it's not enough to state facts; we need to understand their story, then offer a respectful new story that might shift their attitude. So we're looking to create stories that will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be about an issue related to justice - how we view and treat others, or how we nurture our own better self;</li>
        <li>Be grounded in facts, but not simply be a presentation of facts;</li>
        <li>Identify a specific target audience and their current “story”;</li>
        <li>Suggest (maybe implicitly) an attitude shift or an ask for action;</li>
        <li>Be a story that hooks you in and doesn’t let you go!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ultimately, we want stories that can shift attitudes.</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="what_types_of_stories">What types of stories/issues are we looking for?</h3>

      <p>We're looking for issues that affect how we see ourselves, our neighbours, our country, our world. And we hope that once we shift that lens, we'll shift our attitudes. And if we shift our attitudes, we'll begin to take steps, even baby steps, to building a more fair and more balanced world.</p>
      <p>Here are a few ideas of the types of stories we've brainstormed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An issue that's important but not topical - like restorative justice, the foster care system or early childhood education.</li>
        <li>A highly charged issue but one the you have a new take on - for example examining the question of guns through military veterans for better gun safety, or climate change by targeting farmers concerned about droughts.</li>
        <li>An issue that asks us to think about how we live our own lives - maybe to think differently about generosity, or gratitude, or forgiveness - or that asks liberals to ask how we need to change our own ways/attitudes to help unblock change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are <a href="http://re3storyhack.org/sample_stories.html">three sample story nominations</a>.</p>
      <p>But we're open to all types of issues, so take a few moments and express what's important to you, and we'll happily offer feedback!</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="who_can_submit">Who can submit a story?</h3>

      <p>Anyone can, but we're looking for nominators as individuals, not organisations. Many individuals might be associated with organisations, but we aren't creating campaigns for a particular organization. And we certainly aren't going to do anything related to fundraising.</p>
      <p>We want to be able to do edgy work, and we've found that being too closely affiliated with an organization can add too many layers of decision making/approval.</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="what_you_can_expect">What you can expect as a story nominator?</h3>
      <p>First, submit your idea, or as many ideas as you want. The earlier you submit it, the more feedback you get!  After submission, you'll get feedback from the Re3Storyhack team, then  have a chance to officially submit your idea (in the same format as the sample nominations). If it's a finalist, here's what you'll get:</p>

      <p><strong>Between Sept 15-30th: We'll offer a storyteller to help you craft a "storytelling brief"</strong><p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refine the audience you are trying to reach;</li>
        <li>Define the attitude shift that you are seeking to produce;</li>
        <li>Help you find more data and ideas to support your premise;</li>
        <li>Discuss different media you could use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>October 4-6: During the Hackathon, you'll get two days from a crack-design team</strong></p>
      <p>A creative story-telling design team will help translate that brief into a magical story. Each story will involve different types of products. It's still a bit of an experiment. But we think the right magic is there for something special to emerge.</p>
      <p>After the Hackathon, it will be up to you whether/how to keep your team engaged, if they are interested, or to continue it further with other resources.</p>
    
      <h3 class="question" id="what_do_we_win">What do we win and who are the judges?</h3>
      <p>We’re working to get a half-dozen celebrity judges to assess your work! And by celebrity we mean less JZ and more a tewnty first century AEsop! As we confirm them, we’ll let you know!</p>
      <p>We’re also working with organisations to help the winning teams get exposure, through the media and storytelling conferences. And we might even be able to scrounge together a couple of gadget prizes too!</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="what_kind_of_teams">What kind of teams do you expect?</h3>
      <p>A story or an issue can be submitted by anyone. But we’ll be looking to make teams many of the following roles is filled – sometimes one person can fill multiple roles</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The subject matter expert</strong> – Someone who can lay out the big-picture context for an issue, inspire people to care about it. Subject matter experts have deep knowledge of relevant facts, and can provide rigorous reality checks for the creatives.</li>
        <li><strong>The audience surrogate</strong> – someone who knows the target audience really well, or who can access them easily.</li>
        <li><strong>The story evangelist</strong> – someone who will take the story that’s produced and promote it incessantly.</li>
        <li><strong>The team leader</strong> – someone with great leadership, creative vision and project management skills. You are a decisionmaker, and unifier. You know how to keep creatives focused, motivated and moving forward.</li>
        <li><strong>The creative storyteller</strong> – someone who knows how to convey stories in compelling and unexpected ways that form memorable impressions. You can be a designer, developers, data scientists, filmmakers, editors, writers, illustrators , animators, or anything else we haven't thought of.</li>
        <li><strong>The data scientist</strong> – an analyst who can detect patterns and trends from complex databases in a magic-like manner. Data scientists can connect big numbers to big ideas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="question" id="more_involved">I'm really excited about this - can I get more involved?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Email us at <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org" target="_blank">seeyou@re3storyhack.org</a></p>

      <h3 class="question" id="who_are_the_organizers">Who are the organizers?</h3>
      <p>We came together as a group of people drawn together by two beliefs.</p>
      <p>As changemakers, we have seen the power of stories to change people's minds, and we have seen the need to craft these stories starting from a position of empathy, not being blindly convinced we are right and others are wrong and trying harder and harder to persuade them. We believe that changemakers who can translate crucial facts into stories will be central to creating change in the digital 21st century, and we want to help them.</p>
      <p>And as creators, we'd felt from  friends and colleagues the hunger to let our creative powers loose on stories that really matter to us and the world. Even a weekend would give those of us who don't work on such issues on a daily basis the chance to engage again, and to reignite that flame.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about who we are and our organisations with a couple of keystrokes on Google!</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="hows_different_from_a_hackathon">How is this different from a hackathon?</h3>
      <p>We have all participated in or organised hackathons. There is lots that's great about hackathons, but we've all struggled sometimes with the inefficiency involved. So we're keeping what's great about a hackathon - a defined container for great energy and creativity - and trying to make it more efficient by pre-curating the stories and teams to help you make the most of your time there so that you can produce a product you are very proud of.</p>

      <h3 class="question" id="whats_next">What's next?</h3>
      <p>Assuming this works, we'd like to offer this to others who want to organize something similar. We're all open-source. We'll share all the back-end organizing tools and lessons, and offer any help we can to people seeking to replicate this elsewhere.</p>
