      <h3 class="question" id="what_is_storytelling">What is justice-based persuasive storytelling?</h3>
      <p>"Storytelling" is a popular word these days. Overused even. This is what it means to us:</p>
      <p>Changemakers working on the most pressing issues tend to be deep in the facts, and rarely do facts change people’s minds. That's because people tend to have an existing story in their head that explains their daily experience - whether it's about crime and punishment, race, immigration, the weather, the food we eat or how we treat our neighbours.</p>

      <p>To reach people, it's not enough to state facts; we need to understand their story, then offer a respectful new story that might shift their attitude. So we're looking to create stories that will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be about an issue related to justice - how we view and treat others, or how we nurture our own better self;</li>
        <li>Be grounded in facts, but not simply be a presentation of facts;</li>
        <li>Identify a specific target audience and their current “story”;</li>
        <li>Suggest (maybe implicitly) an attitude shift or an ask for action;</li>
        <li>Be a story that hooks you in and doesn’t let you go!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ultimately, we want stories that can shift attitudes.</p>
      <br />
      <h3 class="question" id="what_types_of_stories">What types of stories are we looking for?</h3>

      <p>We're looking for issues that affect how we see ourselves, our neighbours, our country, our world. We hope that once we shift that lens, we'll shift our attitudes. And if we shift our attitudes, we'll begin to take steps, even baby steps, to building a more fair and more balanced world.</p>
      <p>Here are a few ideas of the types of stories we've brainstormed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An issue that's important but not topical - like restorative justice, the foster care system or early childhood education.</li>
        <li>A highly charged issue but one the you have a new take on - for example examining the question of guns through military veterans for better gun safety, or climate change by targeting farmers concerned about droughts.</li>
        <li>An issue that asks us to think about how we live our own lives - maybe to think differently about generosity, or gratitude, or forgiveness - or that asks liberals to ask how we need to change our own attitudes to help unblock change.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are <a href="http://re3storyhack.org/sample_stories.html">three sample story ideas</a>, just for reference.</p>
      <p>We're open to all types of social issues, so take a few moments and express what's important to you, and we'll happily offer feedback!</p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="who_can_submit">Who can submit a story?</h3>

      <p>Anyone can – individuals or organizations. If you or someone you know has an amazing perspective on a story, <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org?Subject=New story idea for re3storyhack">we want to hear it</a>! In the case of organizations, please bear in mind that our purpose is not creating marketing campaigns for any particular organization. We want to hear your great stories, but please know that we aren't here to help you with fundraising.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to remove all obstacles so we can create innovative work that doesn't depend on cumbersome decision making and approval processes.</p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="what_you_can_expect">What you can expect as a story nominator?</h3>
      <p>First, <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org?Subject=New story idea for re3storyhack">submit your idea</a>, or as many ideas as you want. After submission, you'll get feedback from the Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack team, then have a chance to submit more information for your idea (<a href="sample_stories.html">check out these examples</a>). The earlier you submit ideas, the more feedback you'll get! If your story is chosen as one of the 10 finalists, here's what happens next:</p>

      <p><strong>Between Sept 15-30th: Craft a "storytelling creative brief", where we will help you:</strong><p>
      <ul>
        <li>Refine the audience you are trying to reach;</li>
        <li>Define the attitude shift that you are seeking to produce;</li>
        <li>Find more data and ideas to support your premise;</li>
        <li>Discuss different media you could use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>October 4-6: During the Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack, you'll get two days from a talented multidisciplinary creative team</strong></p>
      <p>The team will help translate your brief into a powerful, persuasive story. Each story will involve different types of outputs, depending on the creative direction the storytelling teams embark on. This is an experiment, but we have all the ingredients for something special to emerge.</p>
      <p>After the the Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack, it will be up to you whether to keep your team engaged, if they are interested, or to continue it further with other resources.</p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="who_will_judge">Who will judge the work?</h3>
      <p>We’re working to get a half-dozen well-respected personalities to serve as Re<sup>3</sup> judges to assess your work! As we confirm them, we’ll let you know! There are sure to be some surprises.</p>
      <p>We’re also working with organizations to help the winning teams get exposure, through the media, online platforms and storytelling conferences.</p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="what_kind_of_teams">What kind of teams do you expect?</h3>
      <p>Teams will be completely multidisciplinary. The following are the general roles we will look to fill. In some cases one person can fill multiple roles. If your nominated story was selected as one of the finalists, we encourage you to join the team that will be expressing your story.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The subject matter expert</strong> – Someone who can lay out the big-picture context for an issue, inspire people to care about it. Subject matter experts have deep knowledge of relevant facts, and can provide rigorous reality checks for the creatives.</li>
        <li><strong>The audience surrogate</strong> – someone who knows the target audience really well, or who can access them easily.</li>
        <li><strong>The story evangelist</strong> – someone who will take the story that’s produced and promote it incessantly.</li>
        <li><strong>The team leader</strong> – someone with great leadership, creative vision and project management skills. You are a decisionmaker, and unifier. You know how to keep creatives focused, motivated and moving forward.</li>
        <li><strong>The creative storyteller</strong> – someone who knows how to convey stories in compelling and unexpected ways that form memorable impressions. You can be a designer, developers, data scientists, filmmakers, editors, writers, illustrators , animators, or anything else we haven't thought of.</li>
        <li><strong>The data scientist</strong> – an analyst who can detect patterns and trends from complex databases in a magic-like manner. Data scientists can connect big numbers to big ideas.</li>
      </ul>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="more_involved">I'm really excited about this - can I get more involved?</h3>
      <p>Yes! If you want to help sponsor Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack, have ideas for in-kind donations, or want to help in any way, <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org?Subject=Interested in sponsorships">reach out to us here.</a></p>
      <p>If you want to give us some press coverage or connect us to awesome people who can help spread the word about Re<sup>3</sup>, <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org?Subject=Interested in telling the world about Re3>"> please let us know!</a></p> 
      <p>If you're interested in connecting with inspiring do-gooders for a weekend of creation, you can volunteer to help us put this thing on by <a href="mailto:seeyou@re3storyhack.org?Subject=Interested in volunteering">emailing us here</a></p>.
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="who_are_the_organizers">Who are the organizers?</h3>
      <p>We are a group of people drawn together by two beliefs.</p>
      <p>As changemakers, we have seen the power of stories to change people's hearts and minds. We have seen the need to craft these stories from a position of empathy. We are not blindly convinced that we are right and others are wrong. We believe in doing our homework and searching for clarity. We know that changemakers who can translate hard facts into powerful stories will always be at the heart of social change in the 21st century. We're here to help.</p>
      <p>As creators, we know our friends and colleagues are hungry to let their creative talents loose on stories that really matter. One weekend is enough to ignite a flame in those of us who don't get to address social issues on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="index.html#organizers">learn more about us here.</a></p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="hows_different_from_a_hackathon">How is this different from the typical hackathon?</h3>
      <p>We have all participated in or organized hackathons. There is a lot that is great about these events, but we've all struggled sometimes with the inefficiency involved. We're keeping what's great about a hackathon - a defined container for great energy and creativity - and trying to make it more efficient. Re<sup>3</sup> is organized by a group of people who have extensive experience leading creative teams, social change organizations, and technology companies. We'll start by curating stories and teams prior to the event to ensure everyone makes the most of their time during the Re<sup>3</sup> weekend. Throughout the event, we will be hands on providing guidance and making sure we are all working towards something awesome. </p>
<br />
      <h3 class="question" id="whats_next">What's next?</h3>
      <p>If this is as successful as we think it will be, we want to help enable others to organize similar events. We're all open-source. We'll share everything we learn, everything we make, and we'll offer any help we can to people seeking to replicate this elsewhere.</p>
