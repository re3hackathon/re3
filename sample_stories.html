      <h2>Sample Stories</h2>

      <p>Here are three examples of story briefs to help you think about what might be applicable to your issue and how you might frame it. Again - if you have an idea, submit the highlights, and we'll contact you to chat more.</p>

      <h2 id="fairer_and_better_justice">1. Fairer and better Justice</h2>
      <h3>What's your issue?:</h3>
      <p>Shift the conversation around justice away from <strong>"tough on crime"</strong> to ______ (that's your job!)</p>

      <h3>In detail:</h3>
      <p>Studies and stats on justice are unequivocal - the criminal/jail system in the US doesn't do what it's meant to - it doesn't deter potential criminals, it doesn't make victims feel better, and it doesn't reform those convicted, it hardens them.</p>
      <p>So we have a system that's screwed up -  it makes us citizens less safe and it magnifies what might have simply been a mistake in a young person's life and it streams them into a life of crime.</p>
      <p>So why does it persist?</p>
      <p>Because we're hardwired to feel "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth".</p>
      <p>That's why Tough On Crime initiatives are popular. It's instinctive to want to punish people in proportion to the harm they caused.</p>
      <p>Yet new work on Restorative Justice is turning this on its head. It's counter-intuitive, but it has been proven to work. Bring victims and perpetrators together, allow both to hear the other's story. And only then allow a sentence - a punishment - to be proscribed - taking into account what victims suggest. When victims hear the perpetrator say "I'm sorry", that helps them heal more than seeing them punished. When perpetrators come face to face with the pain they create, that's crucial for reform. And a sentence that comes out of this process can be creative, and also keep society safe.</p>
      <p>Yet no one can stand up in America today and advocate for this. You'd be labelled a weak liberal.</p>
      <p>So how can we change the conversation?</p>

      <h3>Who needs to hear about it?</h3>
      <p>We'll start with the general public, but probably a subset of law-enforcement people would be the ones starting to implement these ideas. A group of (tough) victims willing to advocate for changes to the system would be powerful.</p>

      <h3><strong>Some Ideas/hooks</strong>:</h3>
      <p>Targeting specific crimes/circumstance as a wedge/proof of concept; changing the name "restorative justice"; finding unexpected allies (tough-ass texan), finding unexpected spokespeople (victims of violent crimes for restorative justice).</p>

      <h3>Person or Organization proposing issue:</h3>
      <p>Sample idea</p>

      <h3>Back up information and studies, leading implementing organisations, potential allies:</h3>
      <p>To come.</p>

      <h2 id="new_story_on_guns">2. Trying (another) new story on guns</h2>
      <h3>What’s your issue?</h3>
      <p>Guns: not stats, but safety</p>

      <h3>Who needs to hear your story?</h3>
      <p>Liberals who are open to new thinking on guns; gun owners who respect guns but also respect safety.</p>

      <h3>Why is your issue/story important?</h3>
      <p>Lots of the argument on gun control is overtly about deaths. It might also covertly be about liberals who think that owning guns is a bit nuts, and people who own lots of them are a bit crazy. This isnt working.</p>
      <p>Stats don’t persuade people. They don’t reflect most gun owners’ reality.</p>
      <p>The gun issue polarizes into</p>
      <p>“I don’t have a gun and the fact that others do makes society less safe (and besides, it’s an easy thing to get moral about, it doesn’t require me to change my behaviour, I’m asking other americans to change theirs)”</p>
      <p>“I have a gun and putting controls on it is a step toward taking it away, and I feel safer with it. So F*** off”</p>
      <p>I’d like to suggest we try a different message/ideas:</p>
      <p>“accidents happen”. The main message is “98% of gun owners will be responsible. 1 % wont be, and 1% will have accidents. If there’s 100 million guns in the US, that’s a lot of risk. A big chance of someone doing something crazy, and a lot of accidents. What can we do to prevent accidents?</p>
      <p>“Liberals for guns” – a site to say “we liberals are ok with people owning and using guns and never want to take them away, but we do want some safety measures to prevent accidents” And we’ll pay for it. (to show that liberals have some skin in this game too.)</p>
      <p>These are just ideas - but basically, I'd like to see if we can do some fresh thinking about guns.</p>

      <h3>Do you have any ideas for your story/hook?</h3>
      <p>Telling stories and using facts saying that “accidents can happen to anyone.” And that the consequences can be tragic – in both cases. Maybe try to find people who pulled the trigger and regret it. Big tough Texans.</p>
      <h3>What facts/info do you have to back up your story?</h3>
      <p>If this is of interest I’d be available to do extensive research and/or searching to find people who could speak on camera.</p>


      <div class="separator"></div>

      <h2 id="meeting_in_the_middle">3. Meeting in the middle</h2>
      <h3>What’s your issue?</h3>
      <p>Helping Progressive and Conservative Americans better understand each other.</p>

      <h3>Who needs to hear your story?</h3>
      <p>First audience – progressives who think that they are “right” in the culture wars.</p>

      <h3>Pitch us: Why is your issue/story important?</h3>
      <p>Jonathan Haidt’s book “The Righteous Mind” offers a bridge to understanding between progressives and conservatives. It shows how progressives value fairness and “do no harm” most, whereas conservatives also value sanctity, loyalty and authority. Being able to see a situation from another’s perspective is crucial for a conversation.</p>
      <p>As hard as this might sound, I’d like to find a clever way to hook liberals into seeing the issues that matter to them – gun control, abortion, the family and marriage, welfare, the size of government – from a conservative's eyes. (Obviously, I’d like to do vice versa too, but I don’t know that audience as well.)</p>
      <p>I think that if we lost some of our sanctimoniousness, we’d be able to reach conservatives better. My question: is there any position that Republicans hold that you agree with? Or that you could learn from? Or that you can genuinely understand? If we answer no to those questions, we probably have blinkers on.</p>

      <h2>Do you have any ideas for your story/hook?</h2>
      <p>Maybe something with split screens, two people reacting to the same thing differently.</p>
      <p>The book has some great funny examples that split liberals and conservatives – “Situation: A young man cooks a chicken for his dinner once a week. But before cooking it, he makes love to it. Is that morally wrong?”</p>

      <h2>What facts/info do you have to back up your story?</h2>
      <p>There are a ton of ideas in the book to build off of. I’d summarize a dozen or so that could feed into a story.</p>
      <p>We could probably invite the author to participate; he’s NYC based.</p>
