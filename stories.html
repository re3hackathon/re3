      <h3>The Stories</h3>
      <div class="separator"></div>

      <h2 class="title">These are the stories we'll be working on.</h2>

      <p>A total of 30 stories were nominated by changemakers for the Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack. Each changemaker put in considerable effort to complete our Story Brief and many committed additional time to working through the details of their story with us on the phone. The Re<sup>3</sup> crew would like to send a huge thank you to everyone for believing in this process!</p>
      <p>After thorough review, the following 10 stories have been selected for creative teams to tackle during the Re3 StoryHack.</p>

      <div class="separator"></div>

      <p>Studies and stats on justice are unequivocal - the criminal/jail system in the US doesn't do what it's meant to - it doesn't deter potential criminals, it doesn't make victims feel better, and it doesn't reform those convicted, it hardens them.</p>
