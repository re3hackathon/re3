      <h3>The Stories</h3>
      <div class="separator"></div>

      <h2 class="title">These are the stories we'll be working on.</h2>

      <p>A total of 30 stories were nominated by changemakers for the Re<sup>3</sup> StoryHack. Each changemaker put in considerable effort to complete our Story Brief and many committed additional time to working through the details of their story with us on the phone. The Re<sup>3</sup> crew would like to send a huge thank you to everyone for believing in this process!</p>
      <p>We're still in the process of reviewing, refiniing and selecting stories and activists/changemakers that we think have important issues and that will of interest to you, the storytellers.</p>
      <p>We'll continue to release more as they get confirmed!</p>

      <h2 id="story_1">1. Privitized prisons for immigrants? Good profits, bad policies.</h2>
<h3>The Issue:</h3>
<p>Private prison corporations have sold the American public a lie, and we have bought it without question.  This lie is that detention - the incarceration of 34,000 non-citizens every day - is necessary to protect the American public and the integrity of our borders.  However, private prisons have failed to tell us that alternatives to detention overseen by communities are 79% less expensive and 95% as effective.</p>
<h3>Why is your story important?</h3>
<p>These private prisons lobby our government to secure Congressionally mandated quotas to ensure their beds are always filled.  They then pass the unnecessary human and financial costs of the immigration detention system onto the American public, making profit from taxpayer dollars. The laws they support force indiscriminate and un-targeted incarceration that rips apart hard-working families. Detained immigrants have fewer rights than someone charged with mass murder. These process issues might not sound like much, but they matter.</p>

<h2 id="story_2">2. Nobody Goes It Alone: Reframing the Poverty Discussion</h2>
<h3>The Issue:</h3>
<p>America is built on a myth of self-sufficiency, of pulling oneself up by one’s own boot straps. But if we get real with ourselves, we all know that none of us make it in life alone. During moments of crisis, we all feel the same things – fear, vulnerability, isolation. And to overcome crisis, we need the same things – stores of resilience, support from friends and family, and resources to stabilize the ship. This is no different whether you’re wealthy or low-income.  Yet we’ve built a system based on the notion that the answer to getting through tough times should be different for our nation’s “poor”.
<h3>Why is your story important?</h3>
<p>If we shift perceptions about those who live in poverty, we will build a social service system that is actually responsive to people’s needs – a system based on human-centered design versus a system built to serve a monolithic, faceless “poor.” This is a story about empathy – not sympathy – for our low-income neighbors. It’s about taking a look at them and in them, recognizing ourselves.

<h2 id="story_3">3. No paid sick days? Corporate cents not common sense.</h2>
<h3>The Issue:</h3>
<p>44 million Americans work without any paid sick days. Many are restaurant and healthcare workers. When they get sick, they have to go to work. So when they get sick, we get sick - during the H1N1 epidemic, 8 million Americans came to work with the virus and infected another 7 million people. It's time to stop this.
<h3>Why is your story important?</h3>
<p>Some large corporations, from Disney to fast food companies - are using political donations to squash changes in laws that would make all of us safer and healthier. They are claiming paid sick time is bad for the bottom line, but research shows that’s just not true. Are we going to let their desire for a few extra cents get in the way of common sense?

<div class="separator"></div>
<h2 id="story_4">4. The myth of representative democracy</h2>
<h3>The Issue:</h3>
<p>One in five Americans is an immigrant or was born in the U.S. to at least one immigrant parent. And less than 1% of the 500,000 state and local elected offices are held by Asians or Latinos. We are not actually the representative democracy we think we are. People of color don’t feel connected to the very democracy that they have come here to be part of.

<h3>Why is your story important?</h3>
<p>Elections need to catch up with demographics. In 1776 an electorate of mainly old white men elected officials who were also old white men. In 200+ years, people marched and blood was spilt to allow women, people of color, immigrants and others to have the simple right to vote. And yet we still elect mostly older white men. We'd like to shift people's attitudes - those who feel represented, and those who don't - on why a democracy that reflects demographics matters.
